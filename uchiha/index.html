			<h3>Uchiha’s Ability</h3>
			<p>The Uchiha clan, one of the most powerful clans in Naruto, is known for its incredible abilities, unique
				dojutsu, and intense emotional strength. Members of the Uchiha clan possess unique powers that make them
				some of the strongest shinobi in the Hidden Leaf Village and in the ninja world. Their powers stem
				primarily from their Sharingan, a dojutsu (eye technique) that grants them a wide range of abilities,
				including enhanced perception, genjutsu, and special combat techniques. Here’s a breakdown of the Uchiha
				clan’s major abilities:</p>
			<img src="uchiha/Sarinnegane.jpeg" alt="">
		</div>
		<div class="eye">
			<div class="Sharingan">
				<a>1. Sharingan</a>
				<p>The Sharingan is the Uchiha clan's signature dojutsu, which manifests as a red eye with black
					tomoe
					(comma-like markings). The Sharingan provides several powerful abilities:

					Enhanced Perception: The Sharingan allows users to perceive fast movements, predict opponents’
					actions,
					and analyze chakra flows, giving them a significant advantage in battle.
					Copying Techniques: With the Sharingan, an Uchiha can instantly copy nearly any ninjutsu,
					taijutsu, or
					genjutsu they see, making it extremely versatile.
					Genjutsu: The Sharingan enables users to cast powerful illusions, trapping opponents in
					hallucinations
					that can disorient or incapacitate them. One of the most famous genjutsu is Tsukuyomi, a
					technique used
					by Itachi Uchiha to control and torture opponents in a hyper-realistic illusion that distorts
					time.</p>
				<img src="uchiha/Sasuke Sharingan.jpeg" alt="">

			</div>

			<div>
				<a>2. Mangekyo Sharingan</a>
				<p>The Mangekyo Sharingan is an advanced form of the Sharingan that is awakened only through the
					intense
					emotional trauma of losing a loved one. Each Mangekyo Sharingan grants unique abilities specific
					to its
					user, and some of the strongest techniques in the series stem from it:

					Amaterasu: A black flame that burns anything in its line of sight, including chakra-based
					defenses.
					Amaterasu flames burn continuously until the target is completely consumed or extinguished by
					the user.
					Susanoo: A powerful chakra avatar that surrounds and protects the user, manifesting as a
					gigantic
					humanoid warrior made of chakra. It provides both offense and defense, with each user’s Susanoo
					having
					unique weapons or forms.
					Kotoamatsukami: An advanced genjutsu exclusive to Shisui Uchiha’s Mangekyo Sharingan. It allows
					him to
					subtly manipulate someone’s mind without them realizing, implanting thoughts or altering their
					actions.
					Kamui: A space-time ninjutsu unique to Obito Uchiha’s Mangekyo Sharingan. Kamui can create
					portals to a
					separate dimension, allowing the user to teleport parts of their body or other objects to avoid
					attacks
					and even travel between locations.
					The Mangekyo Sharingan has a downside, however: overusing it leads to progressive blindness. The
					only
					way to restore vision is by obtaining the eyes of a close relative, resulting in the Eternal
					Mangekyo
					Sharingan.</p>
				<img src="uchiha/sareing.gif" alt="">
			</div>


			<div>
				<a>3. Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan</a>
				<p>The Eteral Mangekyo Sharingan is achieved by transplanting the Mangekyo Sharingan from a close
					relative, usually a sibling. This evolution combines both sets of eyes and grants enhanced power
					and new
					abilities, along with immunity to the blindness caused by overusing the Mangekyo. With the
					Eternal
					Mangekyo Sharingan, users gain even greater mastery of their techniques and can access stronger
					forms of
					Susanoo.</p>

			</div>

			<div>
				<a>4. Rinnegan</a>
				<p>The Rinnegan is the rarest and most powerful dojutsu, considered a legendary eye that appears in
					very
					few individuals. It can only be awakened by combining the chakra of both Uchiha (Indra’s
					descendants)
					and Senju (Asura’s descendants) lineages. The Rinnegan grants abilities such as:

					The Six Paths Technique: Each path grants a unique power, such as the ability to summon
					creatures,
					manipulate gravity, absorb chakra, or revive the dead.
					Chibaku Tensei: A technique that creates a massive gravitational field, pulling in matter to
					form a
					giant sphere, essentially trapping opponents.
					Control over Life and Death: The Rinnegan allows its user to revive the deceased, as seen with
					Nagato
					reviving those who died in Konoha.
					The Rinnegan's powers make it one of the most formidable abilities in the series, often linked
					with
					legends of creation and destruction in the shinobi world.</p>

			</div>

			<div>
				<a>5. Fire Style Ninjutsu</a>
				<p>All Uchiha have a natural affinity for Fire Release and often demonstrate mastery over fire
					techniques
					from a young age. Some of their signature techniques include:

					Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu: A basic but powerful technique where the user releases a large ball
					of fire
					from their mouth.
					Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu: A technique where the user creates smaller, scattered
					fireballs, which
					can be hard to avoid.</p>
				<img src="uchiha/fire.gif">
			</div>

			<div>
				<a>6. The Curse of Hatred</a>
				<p>The Uchiha clan’s power is linked to an emotional concept called the “Curse of Hatred.” Due to
					their
					strong emotional bonds, Uchiha can sometimes be consumed by intense feelings of love or loss,
					which can
					twist into hatred and darkness. This inner turmoil can amplify their abilities, often pushing
					them to
					awaken the Mangekyo Sharingan. However, the Curse of Hatred has also led many Uchiha to tragic
					ends,
					fueling their anger and sometimes making them lose control.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<a>7. Physical Prowess and Tactical Intelligence</a>
				<p>Beyond their dojutsu, Uchiha clan members are naturally skilled fighters with high intelligence,
					speed,
					and agility. Their tactical minds allow them to make quick decisions in battle, adapt to
					opponents, and
					exploit weaknesses. They are often recognized as geniuses in combat, known for their clever
					strategies
					and deep understanding of shinobi tactics.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="Susanoo">
				<a>8. Susanoo</a>
				<p>
					Susanoo is one of the most powerful and iconic abilities of the Uchiha clan, available only to those
					who have awakened the Mangekyo Sharingan in both eyes. It's a massive, humanoid avatar made entirely
					of chakra that surrounds and protects the user. As one of the rarest and most powerful abilities
					granted by the Mangekyo Sharingan, Susanoo serves as an offensive and defensive powerhouse,
					embodying immense destructive power and resilience.</p>
